"""
A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given.
The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The absolute distinct count of this array is the number of distinct absolute
  values among the elements of the array.

For example, consider array A such that:

  A[0] = -5
  A[1] = -3
  A[2] = -1
  A[3] =  0
  A[4] =  3
  A[5] =  6

The absolute distinct count of this array is 5,
 because there are 5 distinct absolute values among the elements of this array,
 namely 0, 1, 3, 5 and 6.

Write a function:

    def solution(A)

that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers,
 returns absolute distinct count of array A.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = -5
  A[1] = -3
  A[2] = -1
  A[3] =  0
  A[4] =  3
  A[5] =  6
the function should return 5, as explained above.

Assume that:

    N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
    each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647];
    array A is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Complexity:
    expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
    expected worst-case space complexity is O(N),
     beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).

Elements of input arrays can be modified.

    return len(set([abs(n) for n in A]))
