"""
A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.
The dominator of array A is the value that occurs in more than 
half of the elements of A.

For example, consider array A such that

 A[0] = 3    A[1] = 4    A[2] =  3
 A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = -1
 A[6] = 3    A[7] = 3
The dominator of A is 3 because it occurs in 5 out of 8 elements of
 A (namely in those with indices 0, 2, 4, 6 and 7) and 5 is more than 
 a half of 8.

Write a function

def solution(A)

that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, 
returns index of any element of array A in which the dominator of A occurs.
The function should return âˆ’1 if array A does not have a dominator.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
For example, given array A such that

 A[0] = 3    A[1] = 4    A[2] =  3
 A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = -1
 A[6] = 3    A[7] = 3
the function may return 0, 2, 4, 6 or 7, as explained above.

Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(1),
beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
Elements of input arrays can be modified.
